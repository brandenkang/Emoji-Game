# Branden Kang's Final Project for Intro to CS

This is the first game I created using Processing. 
Press any key to play in the start screen. 
The objective of the game is to collect the hearts, and to avoid the poops. 
Every time you collect a heart, your score will increase. 
When you hit a poop, you will lose the game. 
You can move past the edges of the screen, and the edgy character will teleport to the opposite side of the screen.
Click the white restart button to restart the game. 

Enjoy
